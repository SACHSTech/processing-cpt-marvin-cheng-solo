# Program Title (edit this)

The objective of the game is to survive for as many rounds as the user can as the bunny while fighting the enemies which are wolves. The user shoud attempt to get to as high of a stage as possible without dying. The user will use the bunny to fight against the wolves, which will be spawning in greater numbers every round. There will be one additional wolf as opposed to the last stage per stage. Gameplay mechanics involve using w,a,s,d to move the bunny and space bar to shoot easter eggs east to hit the wolves. The wolves move in random directions and will shoot every 1.5 seconds. The scoring in this game will depend on how many rounds the user survives and how many lives the player has. If the player has more lives when ending the round, the player will gain more points, rewarding the player if they conserve lives and win rounds. The limitations in this game include things such as the fact that eventually, the user will essentially have to be killed by the wolves as it will be essentially impossible to dodge the bullets without killing the wolves horizontal to the user almost instantly. Further, the wolves bounce around the walls and move in a relatively understandable direction rather than randomly switching direction. Further, my program also does not calculate the number of wolves that are still alive during the round, which could be important in understand how many bullets to dodge when there are too many wolves to cound.
